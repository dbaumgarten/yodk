// define greeting to be hello
define greeting = "Hello"


// definitions can contain previous definitions
define message = greeting + " " + "world"

// you can define a new name for a variable
// if the defined value is a variable name (and nothing else), you can assign to it
// this is practically aliasing :out to :output
define :output = :out

// :output is replaced by ":out" and message is replaced by "Hello world"
:output = message
