:x=(100*2+10/5)*10 // equations only containing constant values are evaluated at compile time
:answ=(not :a) and not :b and not :c and not :d

// If removing comments results in trailing empty lines
// these emty lines are removed (because removing them can not mess up line-numberings)
// This enables long comment-blocks at the end of a file
